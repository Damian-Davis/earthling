Did you know that the game Rock-Paper-Scissors can be dated back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 200 CE)?

I used my knowledge of Node to creat an online game of Rock-Paper-Scissors where you can play against the HTTP server. 

Using the http module, we will build a simple HTTP server. I practiced how to route requests based on pathname and request methods. I  also used other core Node.js components in this projectâ€”I used the fs module to stream HTML files and create an URL object to extract queries from a URL.
